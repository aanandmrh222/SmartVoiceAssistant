# Building a Smart Voice Assistant for Professionals

## 📌 Project Overview
Professionals often struggle to capture action items and important points during meetings while staying actively engaged in conversations. This project aims to solve that problem by developing a mobile application that listens to conversations and automatically extracts actionable information.

## 🎯 Challenge Statement
Build a mobile application prototype that can record voice conversations and convert them into structured digital actions such as tasks, calendar events, or meeting notes.

## 🔥 Core Features
### 1️⃣ Voice Processing
- Record and transcribe voice conversations to text
- Support English language processing
- Basic handling of different accents

### 2️⃣ Action Extraction
- Identify and extract:
  - Action items and tasks
  - Basic meeting details (date, time)
  - Key discussion points

### 3️⃣ Action Generation
- Create calendar events from extracted meeting details
- Generate to-do items with deadlines
- Create basic meeting summary notes
- Share key points via email/messaging

### 4️⃣ User Interface
- Simple, functional mobile interface
- Display transcribed text in real-time
- Allow basic editing of extracted information
- Show processing status

## 🚀 Challenges Faced & Solutions
### 📌 Integration of Multiple Functionalities
Integrating voice recording, transcription, and action extraction into a single application was challenging. Some features worked while others failed intermittently. By using built-in Logcat for error logging and Gemini AI for troubleshooting, I was able to resolve these issues in the main Kotlin code.

### 📌 Dependency Errors
Using outdated dependencies caused several errors. Through research on forums and Gemini AI assistance, I discovered syntax differences in dependency declarations for Android Studio. Updating the dependencies and correcting their syntax resolved the issue.

### 📌 Choosing the Right Development Platform
The first challenge was selecting a suitable platform. After exploring various options, I chose Android Studio due to its ease of use and familiarity.
